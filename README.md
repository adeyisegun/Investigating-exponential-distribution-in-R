## Project Overview
The Exponential Distribution Analysis project focuses on investigating the properties of the exponential distribution in R and comparing its characteristics with the Central Limit Theorem. Through data analysis and simulation techniques, this project aims to gain insights into the behavior of the exponential distribution and its relationship with the widely applicable Central Limit Theorem.

## Data Analysis and Simulation
Data analysis and simulation techniques are employed in R to explore the properties of the exponential distribution. Random exponential datasets are generated, and their probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, and key statistical measures such as mean and variance are examined. By analyzing these properties, we gain a deeper understanding of the exponential distribution.

## Central Limit Theorem Investigation
The project delves into the concept of the Central Limit Theorem and its implications for the exponential distribution. Sampling experiments are performed, and sample means are calculated from exponential datasets. The project analyzes how these sample means converge to a normal distribution as the sample size increases. Visualizations and statistical tests are utilized to showcase this convergence and evaluate the adequacy of the Central Limit Theorem for the exponential distribution.
